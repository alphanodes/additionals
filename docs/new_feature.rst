`Additionals`_ is `Open-source`_ and it is available at `Github <https://github.com/alphanodes/additionals>`_

If you want to implement new features in it or if you want to change something, you can provide a pull request.

The plugin is maintained by `AlphaNodes`_ for free as far as possible. In case you want a feature, which is not available
and you are not capable of implementing it yourself, you can request this feature from `AlphaNodes`_.

We are an `Open-source`_ company from Munich and we are usually getting payed for our time we spent on development. As we know our plugin at its best we are glad to take this job from you. In case the requested plugin changes still
fit to the plugin purpose. Please, contact us in case you are interested in plugin development.
